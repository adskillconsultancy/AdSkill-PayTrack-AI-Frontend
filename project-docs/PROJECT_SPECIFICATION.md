# 1. Role-Based Feature Matrix (Features Separated by Role)

The platform operates on **4 canonical roles** with least-privilege role-based access control (RBAC). Shared staff logins are strictly prohibited.

### 🔐 User Registration & Role Assignment Workflow
1. **Default Registration (All Users Register as Client):**  
   Whenever a user signs up or self-registers through the application, their role is automatically and strictly set to **`Client`** by default. Public users cannot self-select or register into staff, manager, or admin roles.
2. **Role Promotion & Management (Super Admin Exclusive):**  
   Only a **Super Admin** has the authority to view registered users and update/promote their role to **Manager**, **Consultant**, or another **Super Admin**.
3. **Phased Evolution:**  
   The capabilities listed below represent the **Initial Core Features** for MVP. Additional features (e.g., immigration document checklists, attorney collaboration, advanced CRM) will be added in subsequent phases.

```

# 2. Complete Project Specification (26 Document Sections)

---

### Section 1: Executive Direction
- **Core Purpose:** Develop a company-owned platform that gives AdSkill staff one reliable source of truth for each client's financial account and gives each client a private view of only their own records.
- **MVP Priority:**
  - Accurate deterministic accounting logic.
  - Strong role-based access control.
  - Payment schedules and milestone tracking.
  - Branded invoices and payment receipts.
  - Automated & manual reminders.
  - Comprehensive auditability.
- **Future Direction:** Immigration case stages, document checklists, appointments, staff tasks, secure messaging, and attorney collaboration (expansion into full AdSkill CRM).
- **Critical Philosophy on AI:** AI may explain and summarize verified records, but it must **never invent or independently change financial data**.
- **Deployment Recommendation:** Use the existing AdSkill domain with a subdomain such as `portal.[ADSKILL DOMAIN]`. The main website remains unchanged. Developer needs controlled DNS access only for required records. No transferring of domains, nameserver changes, or sole ownership of company assets.

---

### Section 2: Domain, Hosting, and Ownership
- **Environments:**
  - **Production:** `portal.[ADSKILL DOMAIN]` (or payment-only alternative: `payments.[ADSKILL DOMAIN]`).
  - **Staging:** `staging-portal.[ADSKILL DOMAIN]`, protected by basic auth / IP restriction from public access and search indexing.
  - **Development:** Local environments with test databases and test-mode payment keys.
- **Security & Ownership Requirements:**
  - Force HTTPS with automatically renewing SSL certificates (e.g., Let's Encrypt / AWS ACM / Cloudflare).
  - Source code must reside in a private Git repository owned and controlled by AdSkill.
  - Domain, hosting, database, email, payment (Stripe), file storage, and AI accounts must be owned or directly controlled by AdSkill.
  - **Anti-Lockout Rule:** No external developer may remain the sole administrator of an essential service or credential.

---

### Section 3: Roles and Permissions
Enforce strict least-privilege access. Every user must possess an individual authenticated account; shared staff logins are strictly prohibited.

#### 📌 Registration & Role Update Governance
- **Default Registration Status:** All new users registering through the portal are automatically assigned the **`Client`** role. Public signups can never choose or grant themselves staff or management roles.
- **Role Elevation Authority:** Only a **`Super Admin`** has permission to modify, promote, or assign roles to users (promoting a Client to `Manager`, `Consultant`, or `Super Admin`).

| Role | Initial Core Permitted Access Scope |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Super Admin** | All clients, employees, roles, financial settings, approvals, reports, integrations, and audit logs. |
| **Manager** | Create plans, verify payments, issue invoices and receipts, send reminders, and view financial reports. |
| **Consultant** | View assigned clients, payment status, and notes; no deletion, refund approval, or security administration. |
| **Client** | View only their own fees, schedules, payments, receipts, and secure payment options; cannot edit financial records. |

> *Note: These represent the Initial Core Features for each role. Additional specialized features will be added in subsequent phases.*

---

### Section 4: Client Profile
- **Identity & Contact Data:**
  - Automatically generated unique Client ID (e.g., `ASK-2026-0001`).
  - Full legal name and preferred name.
  - Email address, phone number, WhatsApp number, physical address, country of origin/residence.
  - Preferred language and explicit communication consent records.
- **Service & Case Details:**
  - Service or case category (e.g., EB-2 NIW, EB-1A, Consultation).
  - Assigned consultant / case manager.
  - Agreement execution date, service start date, case status, and financial payment status.
- **Document & History Association:**
  - Uploaded retainer/service agreements, invoices, receipts, and proof of payment uploads.
  - Internal staff notes (strictly hidden from client) vs. client-visible notes.
  - Complete chronological activity timeline.
- **Duplicate Prevention:**
  - Automatic duplicate detection based on email address, phone/WhatsApp number, and matching legal names.
- **Data Minimization Rule:**
  - The payment MVP must **not** collect unnecessary immigration documents or sensitive identity data (e.g., SSN, passport originals) unless required for billing identification.

---

### Section 5: Services and Fee Separation
Administrators can configure catalog services including EB-2 NIW, EB-1A, EB-3, E-2, L-1, Family Immigration Support, Visa Application Assistance, Business Formation, Consultation, DMV/PSB Services, and Custom Services.

- **Strict Accounting Separation:**
  - AdSkill professional fees must be recorded and displayed separately from:
    - Attorney fees
    - USCIS or government filing fees
    - Business plan writing fees
    - Credential evaluations
    - Certified translations
    - CPA / corporate licensing fees
    - Other third-party expenses
- **Adjustments & Deductions:**
  - Record discounts, refunds, write-offs, and applicable taxes as separate line items with required justification.
- **Revenue Recognition:**
  - Government and third-party pass-through fees must **not** automatically count as AdSkill earned revenue.

---

### Section 6: Payment Plan Creation
- **Data Capture:**
  - Original base service price.
  - Applied discount amount and mandatory discount reason.
  - Final contracted fee and required deposit amount.
  - Installment breakdown: count, individual installment amounts, due dates, grace period (days), late-payment policy, and agreed payment method.
- **Schedule Types:**
  - Fixed schedule (e.g., deposit + 3 equal monthly payments).
  - Recurring schedule (e.g., monthly retainer until completion).
  - Fully custom schedule (milestone-based payments tied to case events or customized dates).
- **Validation Rules:**
  - Mathematical integrity check: $\sum \text{Installments} + \text{Deposit} == \text{Contracted Fee}$. The system must reject any schedule where the sum does not match.
- **Amendments & Versioning:**
  - Allow authorized staff to amend payment plans.
  - Preserve the original plan and all historical revisions in the immutable audit log.
  - Require explicit confirmation dialog before committing material financial adjustments.

---

  - Single bulk payment applied across multiple upcoming installments.
  - Reversals, failed payments, credit card disputes, and approved refunds.
- **Comprehensive Status Lifecycle:**
  - `Draft`: Initial schedule item created but not published.
  - `Scheduled`: In the future, not yet active.
  - `Upcoming`: Due within the reminder horizon (e.g., 7 days).
  - `Due Today`: Milestone due on current calendar day.

- **Payment Processing:** Stripe Hosted Checkout, Payment Links, and Stripe Webhooks.
- **Email Delivery:** Resend / SendGrid / AWS SES with SPF, DKIM, and DMARC verification.
- **AI Layer:** Server-side proxy calls only to secure LLM endpoints with permission-filtered context; no direct client API key exposure.

### Section 20: MVP Deliverables
1. Staff authentication system with MFA and role-based permissions (Super Admin, Manager, Consultant, Client; all self-registrations default to Client, upgraded by Super Admin).
2. Client profile management with duplicate detection.
3. Service catalog and fee separation logic (AdSkill fee vs. third-party pass-through).
4. Payment plan creation engine (fixed, recurring, custom) with mathematical sum validation.
5. Manual payment recording and verification workflow.
6. Stripe-hosted checkout and automated webhook reconciliation.
7. Deterministic financial calculation engine (balances, overdue tracking, aging).
8. Automated and manual email reminder notifications.
9. Dynamic branded PDF invoice and receipt generation.
10. Dedicated Management Dashboard & dedicated Client Portal Dashboard.
11. Search, filtering, and CSV/Excel export tools.
12. Comprehensive immutable audit logging and daily encrypted backups.

### Section 21: Future Phases
- **Phase 2 (CRM Expansion):** Case-stage tracking, document checklists, appointment scheduling, internal task manager, intake forms, e-signatures, and attorney collaboration tools.
- **Phase 3 (Enterprise Integrations):** QuickBooks Online / Xero accounting sync, WhatsApp Business API messaging, SMS reminders (Twilio), multi-branch/office support, and DMV/PSB transaction workflows.

---

### Section 22: Required Testing
- **Financial Calculation Tests:** Unit tests for installment sum validation, partial payments, overpayments, discounts, refunds, currency decimal calculations, and duplicate webhook idempotency.
- **Security & Authorization Tests:** Cross-tenant isolation tests (ensuring Client A cannot read Client B's data via URL or ID tampering), RBAC permission tests, password hashing, and MFA verification.
- **Integration Tests:** Stripe webhook end-to-end lifecycle, email delivery simulation, and PDF generation rendering tests.
- **Environment Rule:** Test data only in non-production environments. Never copy real client PII or production credentials into development environments.

### Section 23: Production Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Staff can create a client and an error-free, mathematically verified payment schedule.
- [ ] Paid, overdue, and remaining amounts compute deterministically and update accurately upon partial payments or refunds.
- [ ] Clients can log in and view strictly their own data, payment links, invoices, and receipts.
- [ ] Online Stripe transactions and verified manual payments update client balances once and only once.
- [ ] Invoices and receipts generate with distinct sequential numbers, accurate line items, and company branding.
- [ ] Email notifications trigger according to the defined schedule and stop immediately upon full payment.
- [ ] Every financial modification creates an auditable record with prior/new values and user attribution.
- [ ] Backups complete and restore successfully in staging without data corruption.

### Section 24: Handover Requirements
- Complete source code in private AdSkill Git repository with clear README and deployment scripts.
- Architecture diagrams, database schemas, and API documentation.
- Administrator guide, staff user manuals, and client portal onboarding guides.
- Credential ownership handover: Domain DNS, hosting accounts, Stripe dashboard, transactional email, and cloud storage registered to company-owned accounts.
- Written warranty period, bug-fix agreement, and ongoing maintenance terms.
- Formal IP assignment confirming AdSkill's 100% ownership of custom software and assets.

### Section 25: Development Process
1. **Stage 1:** Specification, wireframe alignment, and database schema approval.
2. **Stage 2:** Database models, migrations, and RBAC authentication layer.
3. **Stage 3:** Staff & Finance Portal (client management, payment plan builder, manual payment entry).
4. **Stage 4:** Client Portal (dashboard, schedule view, invoice/receipt downloads).
5. **Stage 5:** Stripe payment gateway integration, webhooks, and automated email notifications.
6. **Stage 6:** AI assistant layer with strict retrieval boundaries and guardrails.
7. **Stage 7:** End-to-end integration testing, security audit, and staging deployment.
8. **Stage 8:** Production launch, monitoring, and handover.

---

### Section 26: Contract and Governance
Before initiating production development, formal agreements must specify:
- Scope boundaries, milestone deliverables, payment schedules, and change order protocols.
- Non-disclosure and data privacy compliance.
- Third-party service inventory and estimated recurring operational costs.
- Incident reporting protocols, warranty terms, and post-launch support commitments.

# 3. Execution Roadmap: What To Do Next

Here is the exact step-by-step roadmap to implement this specification into our codebase:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                             STEP-BY-STEP ROADMAP                                 │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  PHASE 1: RBAC & AUTHENTICATION
  ├── Enforce 4 discrete roles: Super Admin, Finance/Manager, Consultant, Client
  ├── Protect routes & navigation by role (hide staff tools from clients)
  └── Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) flow for staff

  PHASE 2: DETERMINISTIC ACCOUNTING ENGINE
  ├── Core decimal/cents arithmetic utility (no floating point calculations)
  ├── Strict validation: Sum(Installments) == Contracted Fee
  └── Status transitions: Draft → Scheduled → Upcoming → Due Today → Paid/Overdue

  PHASE 3: STAFF FINANCIAL WORKFLOWS
  ├── Payment Plan Builder (Fixed, Recurring, Custom milestone schedules)
  ├── Fee Separation (AdSkill consulting fee vs. Attorney & Government filing fees)
  ├── Manual Payment Ledger (Pending → Verified status with receipt upload)
  └── Refund / Reversal / Adjustment modal requiring mandatory written reason

  PHASE 4: CLIENT PORTAL EXPERIENCE
  ├── Dedicated client dashboard displaying current standing & next due date
  ├── Itemized installment milestone view
  ├── Stripe Checkout / Payment Link trigger button
  └── One-click PDF invoice & receipt downloader

  PHASE 5: AUTOMATED NOTIFICATIONS & AUDIT TRAIL
  ├── Trigger emails at -7d, -3d, Due Date, +3d, +7d, +14d
  ├── Automatic reminder halting upon verified payment
  └── Immutable audit log capturing actor, timestamp, IP, old value, and new value

  PHASE 6: AI BOUNDARY & ASSISTANT LAYER
  ├── Permission-aware search across client payment records
  ├── Plain-language payment schedule explainer for clients
  └── Hardcoded guardrails: Block autonomous balance changes, hallucinated data, or legal advice
```
